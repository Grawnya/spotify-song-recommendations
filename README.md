# Spotify Song Recommendations

# Introduction

# Aim of the Application
Welcome to a website dedicated to providing song recommendations for the user using a dataset consisting of Spotify song data. The aim is to provide the user with up to 20 song suggestions based on answers given to the questions asked and then to print them onto a Google Sheet so they can access the song details independently from the Terminal interface.

# How to Use
The user can interact with the application by going into the website and answering the questions on the screen. The user will be asked for:
* Their favourite music artist
* Their favourite genre from a list provided
* The music artist who sings their favourite track or song
* The title of their favourite track
* If they feel like dancing?
* If they want to focus?
* If they want to listen to something popular?

These questions will enable the programme to pick up to 20 songs, returning them one by one in the form of:

Song Name
Artist Name
Duration

The user will be asked to play again, restarting the game if they opt to play again. Otherwise, if they donâ€™t want to play again, a link to the most recent recommendations on a Google Sheet is printed out onto the terminal.
